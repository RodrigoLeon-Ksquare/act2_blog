        <h2 class="subtitle">A brief history about Ciudad del Carmen</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Founded in pre-Hispanic times, Ciudad del Carmen was an important
          place that is due to connect the Aztec and Mayan civilizations.
          Between the 16th and 18th centuries, when the city of Campeche was a
          trade center between Spain and New Spain (Mexico), Ciudad del Carmen
          was habited by pirates and functioned as a port to repair ships and
          fly attacks against the Spanish people. A 1699 map of the Bay of
          Campeche indicates Isla del Carmen as two islands: Tieste I and Port
          Royal I. On the opposite side of the lagoon is a waterway marked
          Logwood Creek; this indicates that the residents were probably English
          and logging was another of their activities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text">
          The city obtained its current name on July 16, 1717, in honor of the
          Virgen del Carmen, considered the protector of the island, when the
          Spanish forces, under the command of Alonso Felipe de Andrade,
          expelled the pirates from the island. Since then, every year at the
          end of July, Ciudad del Carmen becomes the very center of the regional
          social, cultural and religious festivals, in the fair that celebrates
          the protective virgin of the island.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text">
          The city is nicknamed "The Pearl of the Gulf". Ciudad del Carmen was a
          small city dedicated mainly to fishing until the 1970s when oil was
          discovered in the region; since then it has grown and developed
          substantially. To this day, Carmen is known as one of the best places
          to find seafood and "cochinita" in Mexico. In the early 1980s, the
          city could only be reached by ferries called "pangas" or small motor
          boats ("lanchas") that operated between Ciudad del Carmen and Zacatal;
          this changed with the construction of a causeway bridge to the
          mainland in the 1980s (to the east) and another in 1994 (to the west).
          The construction of the first bridge was motivated by the sinking of
          one of the island's pangas which resulted in the death of almost
          everyone on board. El Zacatal Bridge, built in 1994, is one of the
          longest in Latin America.
